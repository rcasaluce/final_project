With respect to ELA process, gases used in a laser generator mainly include process gases, such as halogen gas, Xe gas, Ne gas, and/or He gas, with great variety and large usage quantity. Moreover, service life of the gases is usually three (3) to five (5) days, and the gas(es) in the apparatus must be replaced when its service time reaches this value even if the gas is not being used. Therefore, gas consumption is large, and a great operation cost occurs to the manufacturer.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">An ELA apparatus mainly includes following elements/devices: a laser generator, an optical element, an annealing element, a controller, and a transmission element. The ELA apparatus are so large that it covers an area of tens of square meters to hundreds of square meters and has a weight of dozens of tons. The maintenance cost is high and risk rate is increased because of the complicated structures of the ELA apparatus.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Moreover, most of the components in an ELA apparatus are consumable components, for example, the continuous service life of a laser tube of a laser generator is only about half a year, but a price of the laser tube is above multi-million RMB. In addition, the prices of elements such as a gas pure element, a high voltage element, a pulse extent element, an optical module are all very expensive, and these elements to some extent belong to consumable components. Therefore, a great operation cost is brought due to frequently replace consumption components of an ELA apparatus.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><heading id="h0003">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">At least one embodiment of the present disclosure provides a plasma generator, a plasma annealing device, a deposition crystallization apparatus and a plasma annealing process.

Apparently, the described embodiments are just a part but not all of the embodiments of the present disclosure. Based on the described embodiments herein, those skilled in the art can obtain other embodiment(s), without any inventive work, which should be within the scope of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Because various process gases such as Halogen gas, Xe gas, Ne gas, and/or He gas are needed in an excimer laser annealing device, and the usage quantity is large. Therefore, operation cost is high for the laser annealing method.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">With respect to wiring distribution, an excimer laser annealing device is a single device, and cannot be connected with other devices, so labor cost is increased, and particle introduced opportunity is increased too.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">In terms of process, the laser characteristics of an excimer laser annealing device will be changed with the consumption of the gases, or laser stability is limited.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Because an excimer laser annealing device is large, a manufacture has to choose an integrate device, the probability of substrate oxidation and pollution are increased. Moreover, a window of an excimer laser annealing device is small, the stability of thin film transistors (TFTs) manufactured with it are not high. A scanning method is illustrated in <figref idref="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> in a typical excimer laser annealing technique.

The plasma generator includes: a gas chamber 101; a gas intake member 102 configured to introduce gas 111 into the gas chamber 101; a cathode 103 and an anode 104 which are configured to apply an electric field to the gas 111 introduced into the gas chamber 101 to ionize the gas into plasma; a cooling water circulation member 105 configured to control the temperature of the plasma generator 10; and a plasma beam outlet 106 disposed on a top face of the gas chamber 101.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="f0001">Fig. 2</figref>, in the plasma generator 10 provided by an example of the embodiment, the anode 104 is disposed in the gas chamber 101, the cathode 103 is provided as a top face of the gas chamber 101 or is disposed on the top face of the gas chamber 101. Side walls of the gas chamber 101 can also be formed integrally with the cathode 103 that is provided as the top face. A (e.g., strong) electric filed is created by the cathode 103 and the anode 104 upon a voltage being applied across them.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">For example, in an example of the embodiment, the anode 104 and the cathode 103 are replaceable or have an adjustable size. By changing a size of the anode 104 and the cathode 103 and setting the anode 104 and the cathode 103 to an appropriate voltage value, the requirement of adjusting the plasma beam outlet (opening size) can be satisfied, and linearization of a plasma beam 112 is realized, and a large amount of treatment by optical systems is not needed any more. A voltage between the cathode 103 and the anode 104 of the<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> plasma generator 10 can be provided by a voltage source, and the voltage source can have a wide voltage range to adjust the state of the plasma beam conveniently and flexibly.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="f0001">Fig. 2</figref>, the plasma generator provided by an example of the embodiment can further include an insulating plate 107, and the insulating plate 107 is disposed below the anode 104. The insulating plate 107 is configured to insulate the anode 104 and a component that is adjacent to the anode 104.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="f0001">Fig. 2</figref> and <figref idref="f0002">Fig. 3</figref>, in the plasma generator provided by an example of the embodiment, the gas intake member 102 includes a gas intake pipe 1021. The gas 111 can be introduced into the gas chamber 101 through the gas intake pipe 1021.

For example, the cooling water pipe 1051 can be disposed in the anode 104 and in a side wall or side walls of the gas chamber 101. But the position of the cooling water pipe 1051 is not limited here. A temperature of the plasma generator 10 is controlled by the cooling water circulation member to make the plasma in a designed temperature. For example, the temperature of plasma can be increased by reducing the cooling water flow rate of the cooling water circulation member, or the temperature of plasma can be reduced by increasing the cooling water flow rate of the cooling water circulation member.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">For example, in the plasma generator provided by an example of the embodiment, the gas intake member 102 is configured to introduce (input) a gas to be ionized to generate plasma.

The voltage of a voltage source for the plasma accelerating electric field generated between the first electrode plate 109 and the second electrode plate 110 can be chosen from a wide range to adjust plasma acceleration speed effectively. For example, the first electrode plate 109 and the second electrode plate 110 can be disposed on a top face and a bottom face of the vacuum chamber 30, but their positions are not limited here.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="f0003">Fig. 5</figref>, the plasma annealing device provided by an example of the embodiment can further include a magnetic member 108 that is disposed on the path of a plasma beam 112 of the plasma generator 10 and configured to apply a magnetic field to the plasma beam 112. The magnetic member 108 for example can be disposed in a ring shape on the path of the plasma beam 112. <figref idref="f0003">Fig. 5</figref> can illustrate a sectional view of a ring-shaped magnetic member.

Usually, the gas used to generate plasma is Ar (argon gas).</p><p id="p0064" num="0064">For example, in the plasma annealing process provided by an example of the embodiment, the plasma annealing process is performed in a plasma annealing device, the plasma annealing device includes a vacuum chamber 30 and a plasma generator in the vacuum chamber 30; and the plasma generator includes: a gas chamber 101, a gas intake member 102 configured to introduce a gas into the gas chamber 101, a cathode 103 and an<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> anode 104 that are configured to apply an electric field to the gas introduced into the gas chamber 101 to ionize the gas into plasma, a cooling water circulation member 105 to control a temperature of the plasma generator, and a plasma beam outlet 106 disposed on a top face of the gas chamber 101. The temperature of the plasma generator is controlled by means of the cooling water circulation member 105. The gas, i.e., argon gas, can be ionized to form plasma by an electric field generated by applying a voltage across the cathode 103 and the anode 104. For example, the plasma annealing device can adopt any one of the plasma annealing devices of embodiment 2.</p><p id="p0065" num="0065">For example, in the plasma annealing process provided by an example of the embodiment, the plasma is obtained by ionizing argon gas in an electric field in a plasma generator.</p><p id="p0066" num="0066">For example, in the plasma annealing process provided by an example of the embodiment, a voltage of the electric field between the cathode 103 and the anode 104 is in a range of 1.0-3.0 KV. The ionization of argon gas is controlled by controlling the voltage of the electric field between the cathode 103 and the anode 104, and the voltage control affects process remarkably. For example, the voltage cannot be too large, otherwise the electric field can be so strong that ions can be implanted into the substrate 40 like an implanter.</p><p id="p0067" num="0067">For example, in the plasma annealing process provided by an example of the embodiment, the substrate 40 that is provided with an amorphous silicon thin film can be disposed above or below the plasma generator.</p><p id="p0068" num="0068">For example, in the plasma annealing process provided by an example of the embodiment, during an annealing process, the distance between the plasma generator and the substrate 40 that is provided with an amorphous silicon thin film is in a range of 1-10 mm. The distance is an important factor to affect the process. The distance can be designed to be controllable, usually, the distance can be 3 mm, otherwise the plasma may not reach the substrate to provide enough heat, or energy is too large to generate defect such as ion implanting.</p><p id="p0069" num="0069">For example, in the plasma annealing (PA) process, a scanning method of the substrate 40 is illustrated in <figref idref="f0004">Fig. 8</figref>; the drawing shows a face-down type in which the substrate is at an upper level and the plasma beam is at a lower level (the platform is disposed<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> above the plasma generator), and therefore, particle generation can be avoided. A type in which the plasma beam is an upper level and the substrate is at a lower level can also be adopted (the platform is disposed below the plasma generator). The process can include following steps.</p><p id="p0070" num="0070">Step 1: allowing the substrate 40 to enter the vacuum chamber 30 of a PA device from the upstream vacuum chamber e.g. the vacuum chamber 30' of the CVD device.</p><p id="p0071" num="0071">Step 2: turning on the plasma beam, e.g. argon plasma beam.</p><p id="p0072" num="0072">Step 3: allowing the platform 20 to carry the substrate 40 to move with respect to the plasma beam to realize plasma beam scanning.</p><p id="p0073" num="0073">Step 4: finishing movement of the platform 20, and turning off the plasma beam.</p><p id="p0074" num="0074">For example, the plasma annealing process provided by an example of the embodiment, before the annealing process, further includes a step of baking the substrate 40 that is provided with an amorphous silicon thin film.</p><p id="p0075" num="0075">For example, in the plasma annealing process provided by an example of the embodiment, the vacuum chamber 30 of the plasma annealing device is connected with a vacuum chamber 30' of a CVD device, before the annealing process to the substrate that is provided with an amorphous silicon thin film, it is not necessary to perform a cleaning process to the substrate after being baked.</p><p id="p0076" num="0076"><figref idref="f0005">Fig. 9</figref> is a process flow comparison diagram between an ELA process and a PA process provided by one embodiment of the present disclosure. From <figref idref="f0005">Fig. 9</figref>, it can be seen that, by means of a PA process, the process of cleaning performed after baking the substrate 40 can be omitted. The PA method, with respect to the ELA method, has a simple process flow, because the annealing is concluded in a vacuum environment, the substrate 40 will not be oxidized, and particles from external environment cannot be introduced, and processes such as a cleaning using HF and a particle cleaning are not needed any more. From this point of view, operation cost can be reduced by reducing process flow.</p><p id="p0077" num="0077">It is to be noted that, the embodiments and the drawings only a schematic depiction related to the present disclosure, others not involved can be referred to a usual design.<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --></p><p id="p0078" num="0078">At least one embodiment of the present disclosure provides a plasma generator, a plasma annealing device, a deposition crystallization apparatus and a plasma annealing process.
